Geocoder setup scripts
============
# Description
This folder contains different folders for the SQL scripts needed in order to generate the triggers, tables or types needed for the geocoding functionality.

# Known issues
* Data types creation missing. Some of them are available in each section. The old information about these response data types can be found in the Wiki of the project, but it is deprecated.

# Historic
* [19/10/2015]:
  * Creating a structure inside setup folder so that the different geocoders can be installed independently
* [October 15']:
  * Working on specifying data types in each geocoder subfolder.
